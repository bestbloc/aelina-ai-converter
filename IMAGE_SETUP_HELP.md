# 🖼️ Aelina Image Setup Guide

## 🎯 **Quick Fix Options**

### **Option 1: Save the Image File (Recommended)**

1. **Right-click** on the beautiful cyborg image you shared
2. **Select "Save Image As..."**
3. **Save it as:** `aelina.jpg` (exact filename, no spaces!)
4. **Save location:** Same folder as your `index.html` file

**Your folder should look like:**
```
📁 Your Project Folder/
├── 📄 index.html
├── 📄 styles.css
├── 📄 script.js  
├── 📄 README.md
└── 🖼️ aelina.jpg  ← The image goes here!
```

### **Option 2: Try Different File Extensions**

The code will automatically try these filenames:
- `aelina.jpg` (most common)
- `aelina.jpeg`
- `aelina.png`
- `./aelina.jpg`
- `images/aelina.jpg`

### **Option 3: Check Current Status**

1. **Open your site** (`index.html`)
2. **Press F12** to open Developer Tools
3. **Look at Console tab** - you'll see messages like:
   - `"Aelina portrait loaded successfully!"` ✅ (Working!)
   - `"Trying image source 1: aelina.jpeg"` ⏳ (Still trying...)
   - `"All image sources failed, showing placeholder"` ❌ (Need to save image)

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Image Not Showing:**
- ❌ **Wrong filename:** Make sure it's exactly `aelina.jpg`
- ❌ **Wrong location:** Must be in same folder as `index.html`
- ❌ **File type:** Try saving as `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`

### **Placeholder Showing Instead:**
- 🔄 **This is normal!** It means the image file isn't found
- ✨ **The placeholder animates** with retro cyborg colors
- 📝 **Shows:** "🤖 AELINA AI CYBORG ASSISTANT"

### **Image Too Large/Small:**
- 📐 **Automatic resizing:** The CSS will fit it to 120x120px frame
- 🖼️ **Any size works:** The code handles different image dimensions

## 💡 **Testing Your Setup**

1. **Save the image** as `aelina.jpg` in your project folder
2. **Refresh your webpage** (F5)
3. **Check the console** (F12) for success messages
4. **You should see:** Aelina's beautiful cyborg portrait in the retro frame!

## 🎨 **Backup Plan**

If you can't save the image:
- **The animated placeholder looks great too!** 
- **Retro cyborg gradient** with glowing effects
- **Fits the Windows 95 aesthetic** perfectly
- **Users will still see "Aelina AI" branding**
